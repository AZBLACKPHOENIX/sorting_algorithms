Best Case: O(n) - This occurs when the list is already sorted, and no swaps are needed.
Average Case: O(n^2) - In the average case, multiple passes may be required to fully sort the list.
Worst Case: O(n^2) - Similar to the average case, when the list is in reverse order, it requires multiple passes.
